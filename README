dvsmon
By Carl Karsten

Manages DVSwitch components: GUI server, sources and sinks.

Attempts to find a reasonable place to store dv files by looking at dirs in ~/Videos, /media, for a dir that is writable and has at least 1gig of free space.

Finds the test-123.dv files.

Other than that, it just runs commands and displays their output.  
See the dvswitch docs for descriptions of the dvswitch commands.

To test the app (using ping instead of dvswitch):
./dvs-mon.py 

To run in production:
./prod.sh

docs:
./dvs-mon.py --help
