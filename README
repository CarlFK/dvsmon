dvsmon
By Carl Karsten

Manages DVSwitch components: GUI server, sources and sinks.

Attempts to find a reasonable place to store dv files. By looking at dirs in ~/Videos, /media,for a dir that is writable and has at least 1gig of free space.

Other than that, it just runs commands and displays their output.  See the dvswitch docs for descriptions of the commands.
