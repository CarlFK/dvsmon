dvsmon
By Carl Karsten

Manages DVSwitch components: GUI server, sources and sinks.

Attempts to find a reasonable place to store dv files by looking at dirs in ~/Videos, /media, for a dir that is writable and has at least 1gig of free space.

Finds the test-123.dv files.

Other than that, it just runs commands and displays their output.  
See the dvswitch docs for descriptions of the dvswitch commands.

Can be installed from:
https://edge.launchpad.net/~carlfk/+archive/ppa

to test the app (using ping instead of dvswitch):
./dvs-mon.py -c test_ping.py
